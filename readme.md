WOW I learned a lot on this one! 

Getting a feel for using lists in html to set up the bottom and top nav bar was difficult.

I learned about styling text that is wrapped with <a> tags. 

I learned more about bottons - how to style and size them to what I want. 

I'm still having issues with "float" in css. It didn't work at first and took a lot of diddling. 

I used a lot of "id"'s in this page which I was trying to avoid. Things like the icons on the top right were extremely hard to edit without it or with "parent" elements. 

I copied a lot of this straight from google.com html, but I feel like I've taken a big step. On to the next one.
